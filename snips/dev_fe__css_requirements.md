## CSS Requirements
- Use CSS3 Media Queries to load different styles for each page. Do not build different page for different device/layout.
- You may use SCSS in the project.
- Autoprefixer can be set up as a part of build process.
- You may use Stylelint in the project.
- Provide comments on the CSS code. We need CSS comments to give a clear explanation of the code usage. The goal is to help future developers understand the code.
- Please use clean INDENTATION for all CSS so developers can follow the code.
- All CSS naming should not have any conflicts.
- As possible use CSS3 style when create all styling.
- Use CSS to space out objects, not clear/transparent images (GIFs or PNGs) and use proper structural CSS to lay out your page.
- Only use table tags for tables of data/information and not for page layout.
