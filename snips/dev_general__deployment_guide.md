## Deployment Guide and Validation Document
Make sure to require two separate documents for validation.

A README.md that covers:

*   **&lt;Deployment>** _Make sure you mention if something other than just a local build is required.  For instance, do you want competitors and reviewers to ensure the app deploys successfully to Heroku?  Do you want the app tested on a specific version of Android or iOS?_
*   **&lt;Configuration>  _Most apps have configuration values.  Competitors need to know that they need to document the possible configuration values.  If configuration values already exist but are added to or changed by a challenge, competitors need to know that they need to update the documentation_**
*   **&lt;Dependency installation>  _Competitors will assume that reviewers and others are familiar with the build environment, no matter how complex it is.  Your spec should clearly describe that a step-by-step guide for installing dependencies is required and should be kept up to date with each new challenge for a particular project._**

A Validation.md that covers:

*   **&lt;Validation of each requirement>  _For each numbered requirement, there should be a matching numbered validation item in the Validation.md file that describes how the requirement can be validated by reviewers._**

Validation video / screencast

*   _This is optional, but can be quite helpful for review and validation.  If you are running a UI focused challenge, this can also give good insight into problems with submissions._
