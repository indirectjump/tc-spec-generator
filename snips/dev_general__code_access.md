## Code Access
Most challenges will be extensions / additions / changes to existing code, not a fresh project.  If you are running a code challenge to change existing code you need to clearly define where the code is, what branch to use, and how to gain access to the code.

A public Github repository is easiest, but [Topcoder X](https://x.topcoder.com/) can be used to give access to competitors.

**Make sure the existing code has up-to-date documentation!  **If your existing code isn’t well documented and is hard to deploy, it will frustrate competitors and will lessen the likelihood that you’ll get a submission.  It will also mean a lot of extra questions to answer in the challenge forum.

You want to get as many competitors up and running as quickly as possible for your challenge.  To do that, you need to ensure that your documentation is extremely clear and that you’ve taken steps to ensure setup is easy and can be done quickly with one or two commands.  For instance, when the UML Tool was being worked on, we had great member response and activity, and the UML Tool could be run by downloading the sources and executing “ant run”.  That made the development process easy for everyone involved.
