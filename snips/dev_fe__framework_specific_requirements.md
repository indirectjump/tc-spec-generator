## Framework Specific Requirements
- Code should follow the best practices of [ECMAScript 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) (ES5) or above.
- Split the code into Reusable components.
- For ReactJS based applications, there should be two types of component 
  - Container components (aka Smart components): Components those connect with the central store.
  - Presentational components (aka Dumb components): Components those rely on smart components for data.
  - For more visit  [https://redux.js.org/basics/usagewithreact#presentational-and-container-components](https://redux.js.org/basics/usagewithreact#presentational-and-container-components). 
- For AngularJS based applications these are the expected modules:  Core, Shared and lazy-loaded Feature modules.
  - Core Modules:  All services which have to have one and only one instance per application (singleton services) should be implemented here.
  - SharedModule: All the “dumb” components and pipes should be implemented here.
  - Lazy Loading: 	We should lazy load our feature modules whenever possible. 
- If the official framework documentation says specific way or approach to do something, and you did differently with no solid reason, that's valid for scoring down.
- For any other framework, follow the guidelines listed in _“Application Development Requirements” _section or else ask in challenge forums.
