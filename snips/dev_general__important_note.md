## Important Note
This section is optional, but would be a good place to document important information that may help a _competitors_ decide if they want to be part of this particular challenge.  For instance, is the timeline edited beyond the default for any reason?  Is the review timeline shortened?  Is an odd scorecard used?  Are there requirements for _competitors_ that compete in this challenge, like being a US citizen, having additional documentation on file beyond the NDA, odd hardware like a Raspberry Pi or anything else?  If we document those important notes at the beginning of a challenge specification, it will help _competitors_ quickly rule out challenges that don’t match what they’re looking for.
