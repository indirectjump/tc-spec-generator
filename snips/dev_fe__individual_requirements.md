## Individual Requirements
For each individual requirement, we want to cover these in enough detail to not only implement the requirement but also **review** the change.  You need to provide more detail than you would think necessary because reviewers need to evaluate all submissions against these requirements.

Please number each requirement, title it, and describe if it’s a major or minor requirement.  The numbering helps with forum questions, allowing competitors to quickly reference specific requirements.  Having the list of requirements explicitly defined also helps to see scope in a new light.  If your list of requirements becomes long and looks overwhelming, then it probably is and  you should strongly consider splitting up the requirements into multiple challenges. 

For instance:

**1. Login panel (Major requirement)**

**&lt;Requirements description>**

- &lt;Add the marvel-app link and/or zeplin link details (if any)>.
- &lt;Describe the functional requirement, layout requirements and other briefings.>
