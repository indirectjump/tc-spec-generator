## What to Submit
This section needs to cover what competitors need to provide in their submission.  Make sure to explicitly document the README.md and Validation.md described above.

Things to think about for submission requirements:


*   If you are having competitors work on code in Git, make sure to document the branch and commit hash they need to target with a patch file.  This is important so that reviewers can apply the changes easily
*   Do you want dependencies submitted?  This can increase the size of submissions but make review a bit easier.
*   Do you require an installable build of your app as part of the submission?
*   Do you require a link to a deployed version of the web app that can be used for quick validation?
*   Do you require a video for validation purposes?
*   Be specific about what will be reviewed.  For example, if you ask for both the code and a link to a working demo, then which one takes precedence?  If I have a great working demo deployed on Heroku, but by actual Code that I am submitting is incomplete, then what should the reviewers score?
