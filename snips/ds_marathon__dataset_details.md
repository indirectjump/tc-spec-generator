## Dataset Details
The training dataset is provided in the match forum, accessible after the registration. It is a CSV file with following columns:

- X, and Y are the longitude and latitude coordinates at Earth surface in degrees according to [WGS84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System#A_new_World_Geodetic_System:_WGS_84). The points are distributed evenly on a regular rectangular grid covering the Earth's surface in a WGS84 geographic projection. You will find however, that our data are sparse, and the values in other columns are present only for some points where they are known. Your ultimate goal in this challenge is to output for each X, Y point in the input a single number: the estimated paleo-terrain level at that coordinate, expressed in meters.
- DEM contains the ground truth terrain elevation values (measured in meters) for western hemisphere (X = -180 to 0; Y = -90 to 90). These are the values you aim to reconstruct for the entire globe using information from other columns. During provisional and final scoring this column will be empty in the input. Further below you will find more details on differences between training, provisional, and final datasets.
- Elev_value, Elev_error, Elev_min, Elev_max, and Slope_azimuth are accurate estimations of terrain level you aim to predict, obtained from geologic observations. These are hard restrictions your solution must satisfy at the points where they are given. Specifically:
  - Elev_value and Elev_error are the estimated paleo-terrain level and its estimation error, both in meters. At X, Y coordinates where they are given your output terrain level estimation Zxy must satisfy |Zxy - ElevValuexy| <= 2 ElevError.
  - Elev_min and Elev_max are the estimated lower and maximum bounds on the paleo-terrain level, both in meters. At X, Y coordinates where either of them is given your output terrain level estimation Zxy must satisfy Zxy > ElevMinxy and Zxy < ElevMaxxy.
  - Slope_azimuth is the estimated direction of paleo-terrain slope, given as the angle between the direction to north, and the direction of positive terrain level gradient, measured in degrees in the clockwise direction. At X, Y coordinates where the slope azimuth is provided, the azimuth calculated from your output terrain level must match with it within 5 degrees.
