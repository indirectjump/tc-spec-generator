## Project Background
_(Never more than 3 bullet points. The background must be very clear and concise.)_

- The purpose of this project is to develop a mobile application that will be used by Physicians to track order status and view order results for patients they have under their care. 
- Through the order results, the application will also assist Physicians in determining which antibiotics to prescribe to patients.
- The application will be used at hospitals across the US.
