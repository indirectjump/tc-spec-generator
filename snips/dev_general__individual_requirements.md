## Individual Requirements
For each individual requirement, we want to cover these in enough detail to not only implement the requirement but also **review** the change.  You need to provide more detail than you would think necessary because reviewers need to evaluate all submissions against these requirements.

Please number each requirement, title it, and describe if it’s a major or minor requirement.  The numbering helps with forum questions, allowing competitors to quickly reference specific requirements.  Having the list of requirements explicitly defined also helps to see scope in a new light.  If your list of requirements becomes long and looks overwhelming, then it probably is and  you should strongly consider splitting up the requirements into multiple challenges. 

For instance:

**1. Login panel (Major requirement)**

**&lt;Requirements description>**

**General for all requirements**

Each requirement should be listed as a major or minor requirement, which will help reviewers properly score and evaluate submissions.  This also gives clarity to competitors so that they know where to focus their efforts if they can’t complete everything in the time given, and it clears up a lot of issues in appeals about “should requirement x,y,z be considered major or minor”

Each requirement has to cover positive and negative aspects of the implementation.  For instance, when a button is clicked in a web app, cover what _should_ happen in the UI and the expected result, but make sure to also cover what should happen in the event of a failure.  Think about:



*   How you want the error message displayed to the user (if a UI is required)?
*   Should the error be logged and at what level?
*   Should an action be retried?
*   What should be shown in the UI if a network request is being done?  A spinner?  A progress bar?
*   Should a success message be shown to the user if something works as expected?

If you don’t explicitly cover these sorts of items, submitters will make assumptions that may or may not be appropriate for your project and requirements.
