## Issue Reporting Guidelines

For each report of a limitation or bug, we need the following information:

1. Steps to reproduce, including any needed information (Must list all the steps that need to reproduce the bug, DON'T list only the URL without test data)
2. Current result(s) before the bug is fixed
3. Expected result(s), after the bug, is fixed
4. If it is a UI bug attach a Screenshots (Mark the area where the bug is) | Functional Bug - Videos (You can attach videos directly on GitLab, if not use services like [www.screencast.com](https://www.screencast.com/) Don’t use [www.youtube.com](www.youtube.com) to host the videos) | Crash - Console/Crash Logs. | Performance testing - Support documents
5. Attach the high-level labels. **If you are selecting multiple labels (Platform/Device); You have to provide screenshots for each and every Device/Platform you have selected; If not Bug will be REJECTED. **[Eg: If you select labels Device: iPhone, Device: Android you have to provide screenshots of all the device types you have selected]. Same applies to Platform.
6. Attach detailed platform, device model (iPhone, iPad, Laptop, Desktop), operating system (Window 7 64 bit, iOS 11, Android 7.0 etc.), Frequency in the issue detail.  The high-level labels aren’t sufficient for issue replication and diagnosis.  
7. If it is a comparison, you must provide the URL and Screenshot/video of that location.
