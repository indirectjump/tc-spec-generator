## Bug Fixes
A lot of challenges are groups of general bug fixes that cover items found by QA or groups of small changes a customer has requested.  To ensure that these are implemented and reviewed properly you need to provide information about the bug or requested fix.

Include:

*   **&lt;Reproduction steps for a bug>**.  _If competitors can’t reproduce an issue, it’s not going to be fixed_
*   **&lt;A description of the current functionality>**  _Understanding what happens before the fix can help reviewers test before and after and contrast it with a fix_
*   **&lt;A description of what should happen after the fix has been applied>  _This helps reviewers quickly validate submissions.  Make sure you describe this in as much detail as possible.  Anything not listed or just assumed will likely be implemented different than you’d like_**
